## Dexter
[Dexter](https://rundexter.com) is the bot-writing platform we use. [Read about why](https://bots.qz.com/1360/we-found-the-best-tool-for-building-chat-bots/), and how we landed on it after testing two dozen other tools. Dexter's platform is based on [RiveScript](https://www.rivescript.com/docs/tutorial), though Dexter has added some features and doesn't support all of the language's functions. I taught [a free online course](https://journalismcourses.org/BB0205.html) about using Dexter and RiveScript to make bots.
