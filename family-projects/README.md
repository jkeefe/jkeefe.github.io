# Family Projects for Smart Objects
  
This is the companion website for the book, "Family Projects for Smart Objects" (working title) by [John Keefe](http://johnkeefe.net), due out in Fall 2016 from Maker Media. This is where you'll find links to ingredients for every project in the book, along with the copy-able code you'll need for each project.

## You Only Have to Do This Once

This is the kickoff chapter in the book, and all about getting your Arduino up and running. And you only have to do it once.

### Ingredients

- 1 Arduino Uno (Revision 3)
- 1 Arduino USB cable

You can buy just these parts from Adafruit or Sparkfun using the buttons below.

[Buy from Adafruit >](http://www.adafruit.com/wishlists/403572) [Buy from Sparkfun >](https://www.sparkfun.com/wish_lists/127673)

These ingredients are also found in every Arduino starter kit [I've listed below](#kits).

### Code

There's no code needed for this chapter! But this might be a good time [to download the file](https://github.com/jkeefe/family-projects-sketches/archive/master.zip) containing all of the programs used in this book.

# Kits

To make these projects, you'll need a handful of hobby electronics, which are relatively cheap and readily available. You can buy the parts individually, or you can get "starter kits" that have almost all of the parts you'll need for this book. Here are some of the kits, with (TODO) additional notes about chapters where you may need to get some extra parts:
