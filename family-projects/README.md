# Family Projects for Smart Objects
  
This is the companion website for the book, "Family Projects for Smart Objects" (working title) by [John Keefe](http://johnkeefe.net), due out in Fall 2016 from Maker Media. This is where you'll find links to ingredients for every project in the book, along with the copy-able code you'll need for each project.

## You Only Have to Do This Once

This is the kickoff chapter in the book, and all about getting your Arduino up and running. And you only have to do it once.

### Ingredients

- 1 Arduino Uno (Revision 3)
- 1 Arduino USB cable

You can buy just these parts from Adafruit or Sparkfun using the buttons below.

[Buy from Adafruit >](http://www.adafruit.com/wishlists/403572) [Buy from Sparkfun >](https://www.sparkfun.com/wish_lists/127673)

These ingredients are also found in all of the Arduino starter kits [I've listed below](#kits).

### Installation Links

The book outlines how to install Arduino software on Mac, Windows or Ubuntu computers, but Arduino also works on various flavors of Linux. Here are additional resources:

- [Getting Started with Arduino on Mac OS](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/MacOSX)
- [Getting Started with Arduino on Windows](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows)
- [Installing Arduino on Ubuntu](http://playground.arduino.cc/Linux/Ubuntu)
- [Installing Arduino for Debian](http://playground.arduino.cc/Linux/Debian)
- [Installing Arduino on Fedora](http://playground.arduino.cc/Linux/Fedora)

## Hello Blinky World

Traditionally, when people begin learning something new about computers, 
their first project is to make the computer say, "hello world." Among 
blinky makers, our "hello world" is LED flash on and off. That's what happens in this chapter.

### Ingredients

In addition to your own computer, here's what you'll need for this chapter.

- 1 Arduino Uno (Revision 3)
- 1 Ardunio USB cable 
- 1 LED

### Code

The code for this project actually comes with the Arduino software. You can find it by navigating to the "Blink" sketch by going to the menu bar and chosing _File_ &#8594; _Examples_ &#8594; _01.Basics_ &#8594; _Blink_.

I've also included it in the collection of every program in this book, which [you can download as a file](https://github.com/jkeefe/family-projects-sketches/archive/master.zip). 

Once you do, navigate to your downloads file and unzip (often just by clicking) the file `family-projects-sketches-master.zip`. All of the programs are right there, and can be launched in your Arduino by clicking on them.

# Kits

To make these projects, you'll need a handful of hobby electronics, which are relatively cheap and readily available. You can buy the parts individually, or you can get "starter kits" that have almost all of the parts you'll need for this book. Here are some of the kits, with (TODO) additional notes about chapters where you may need to get some extra parts:
