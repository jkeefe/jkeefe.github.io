# IDEAS

# Potential Assignments

- Look for three articles that touch on three different issues you'd like to investigate. 
- For each article, post a separate Slack message in the `#articles-stories` channel that includes the link and a sentence or two about the article explaining a) what caught your eye and b) how we might build on it with an investigation.  
- You can't post articles someone else has posted! So act fast :-)

- Dox yourself

Post a screen shot of something interesting you found using each tool (so three images total) into the shared Slack channel. Due by noon on December 9, 2019.
