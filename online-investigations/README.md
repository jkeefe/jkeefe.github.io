# Online Investigations at Newmark J School

This is the syllabus, details, and dynamic notes for an investigative journalism [course](https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/courses/online-investigations-2020-election/) at the Newmark Graduate School of Journalism in the Spring of 2020.

# Welcome!

Welcome to this special investigations class geared toward gaining real-world experience investigating online political influence ahead of the 2020 election. We'll be working with the Quartz investigations team, led by John Keefe, to:

- investigate efforts to mislead citizens or undermine civic participation
- analyze political advertising for trends and patterns in content and effect
- collaborate with the Quartz audience to help spot efforts to mislead or divide them
augment classic investigative reporting techniques with audience engagement, machine learning, and crowdsourcing tools
- brainstorm, strategize, and plan story directions and lines of inquiry
- work directly on stories, research, visualizations, or web applications 

We will work as a team, with opportunities for individual focus in any of these areas. Together, all students will take part in contemporary tactics used by today’s leading news organizations. Student work Quartz publishes will be credited by name.

# Logistics and Details

Here's what you need to know to succeed in this class.

## Spirit

We're going to learn how to play, experiment, learn and tinker -- all with the goal of exploring new ways to experience and consume information. This is a hands-on class, and participation is key. Let's have some fun and make great things.

## Location

We generally meet in Room 432 every Monday from 9:30 a.m. to 12:20 pm, including a break. That said, there are several modifications to that due to holidays and other factors, so check out the dates below.

### Computers in Class

Bring them! You'll use your computer in almost every class.

Be here now. Please don't email, DM, tweet, chat or otherwise communicate with people outside the class during class. Your participation with other classmates is key. If you must take a call or a text for an urgent issue, please step out of the room.

### Slack for Communications

Let's strive for a no-email class. We'll communicate using Slack, like just about every newsroom in the United States. It will also allow us to coordinate with journalists at Quartz and elsewhere.

Our Slack is [onlineinvestigations.slack.com](https://onlineinvestigations.slack.com). 

[Use this link to sign up](https://join.slack.com/t/onlineinvestigations/signup), and then use your school email address to complete the process.

Please format your "display name" using your full name, a slash, and your role. Like: **John Keefe / Instructor** or **Lisa Simpson / Student**. This will be especially helpful when other journalists join us.

## Assignments

There will be one assignment given in each class, due in the `#general` channel of Slack _by noon the Friday before the next class_. My intention is that most work for these assignments can be completed in class.

## Grading

There are 100 points possible.

* **Attendance:** 45 points possible, 3 points for each class attended. 
* **Assignments:** 45 points possible, 3 points for each assignment successfully completed. Incomplete or low-effort submissions will get 1 or 2 points. Assignments turned in after noon on the due date receive 1 point.
* **Participation & Progress:** 10 points possible. This will be scored based on your active participation and contribution in class. Note that absences will naturally cut into your participation score.

| Points | Grade |
| ------ | ----- |
| 97-100 |  A+ |
| 93-96 | A |
| 90-92 | A- |
| 87-89 | B+ |
| 83-86 | B |
| 80-82 | B- |
| 77-79 | C+ |
| 73-76 | C |
| 70-72 | C- |
| < 70 | F |

## Plagiarism

Plagiarism is the use of another’s ideas or words, video or recordings, or ideas without properly and clearly acknowledging the source of the information.

This is a journalism class; facts and honesty are our greatest asset. Presenting the work of others as your own is wrong and won't be tolerated. Doing so may result in a significant reduction of accumulated points and possible failure of the class.

When using code or ideas from other sources -- even free, open-sourced code -- be sure to abide by any applicable licenses and include references and links back to the code and licenses. The lack of a license does not mean it's free to use. If you have questions about this, have a conversation about it with the instructor.

If you are inspired by others, note it. It's just right.

When working on teams, as we will in this class, you may be asked to honestly note the specific and/or relative contributions of each teammate.

Please note that other forms of academic dishonesty include:

- Unauthorized collaboration.
- Fabrication of information, quotes, or sources.
- Impeding the work of others.
