# Online Investigations at Newmark J School

This is the syllabus, details, and dynamic notes for an investigative journalism [course](https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/courses/online-investigations-2020-election/) at the Newmark Graduate School of Journalism in the Spring of 2020.

# Welcome!

Welcome to this special investigations class geared toward gaining real-world experience investigating online political influence ahead of the 2020 election. We'll be working with the Quartz investigations team, led by John Keefe, to:

- investigate efforts to mislead citizens or undermine civic participation
- analyze political advertising for trends and patterns in content and effect
- collaborate with the Quartz audience to help spot efforts to mislead or divide them
augment classic investigative reporting techniques with audience engagement, machine learning, and crowdsourcing tools
- brainstorm, strategize, and plan story directions and lines of inquiry
- work directly on stories, research, visualizations, or web applications 

We will work as a team, and on sub-teams, with opportunities for individual focus in any of these areas. Together, all students will take part in contemporary tactics used by today’s leading news organizations. Student work Quartz publishes will be credited by name.

# Logistics and Details

Here's what you need to know to succeed in this class.

## Location

We generally meet in Room 432 every Monday from 9:30 a.m. to 12:20 pm, including a break. That said, there are a few modifications due to holidays, so check out the dates below.

## Computers in Class

Bring them! You'll use your computer in almost every class.

Be here now. Please don't email, DM, tweet, chat or otherwise communicate with people outside the class during class. Your participation with other classmates is key. If you must take a call or a text for an urgent issue, please step out of the room.

## Slack

Let's strive for a no-email class. We'll communicate using Slack, like just about every newsroom in the United States. It will also allow us to coordinate with journalists at Quartz and elsewhere.

Our Slack is [onlineinvestigations.slack.com](https://onlineinvestigations.slack.com). 

[Use this link to sign up](https://join.slack.com/t/onlineinvestigations/signup), and then use your school email address to complete the process.

Please format your "display name" using your full name, a slash, and your role. Like: **John Keefe / Instructor** or **Lisa Simpson / Student**. This will be especially helpful when other journalists join us.

## Assignments

There will be one assignment announced in class and posted on this site on class day. Responses to assignments are due via Slack _by 8 a.m. on the day of the next class._ Unless otherwise noted, these are due in a "public" channel, such as `#general`; please don't submit them to me directly via private message. 

My intention is that most work for these assignments can be completed in class.

## Grading

There are 100 points possible.

* **Attendance:** 45 points possible, 3 points for each class attended. 
* **Assignments:** 45 points possible, 3 points for each assignment successfully completed on time. Incomplete or low-effort submissions will receive fewer or zero points. Assignments turned in after they are due receive a maximum of 1 point.
* **Participation & Progress:** 10 points possible. This will be scored based on your active participation and contribution in class. Note that absences will naturally cut into your participation score.

| Points | Grade |
| ------ | ----- |
| 97-100 |  A+ |
| 93-96 | A |
| 90-92 | A- |
| 87-89 | B+ |
| 83-86 | B |
| 80-82 | B- |
| 77-79 | C+ |
| 73-76 | C |
| 70-72 | C- |
| < 70 | F |

## Absences

Note that being absent really hurts your grade, and right away. But that's intentional — this is a team class, and your participation is key for you and your classmates.

If you are absent for some reason, be sure to seek out and do the assignment for the week. You don't want to lose those points as well.

## Plagiarism

Plagiarism is the use of another’s ideas or words, video or recordings, or ideas without properly and clearly acknowledging the source of the information.

This is a journalism class; facts and honesty are our greatest asset. Presenting the work of others as your own is wrong and won't be tolerated. Doing so may result in a significant reduction of accumulated points and possible failure of the class.

When using code or ideas from other sources -- even free, open-sourced code -- be sure to abide by any applicable licenses and include references and links back to the code and licenses. The lack of a license does not mean it's free to use. If you have questions about this, have a conversation about it with the instructor.

If you are inspired by others, note it. It's just right.

When working on teams, as we will in this class, you may be asked to honestly note the specific and/or relative contributions of each teammate.

Please note that other forms of academic dishonesty include:

- Unauthorized collaboration.
- Fabrication of information, quotes, or sources.
- Impeding the work of others.

# Syllabus and Class Notes

Generally, each class will start with a knowledge-building lesson and/or discussion. Specific class notes for these lessons will be posted on this site before each class.

After a break, you will usually work directly on your investigation — coordinating with teammates, conducting research, analyzing data, making charts, writing, and/or meeting with the instructor.

Below is a rundown of what I expect we'll cover in our weeks together. Be very aware, though, that this is a live journalism class: we will be working on real investigations we hope to publish, and we won't know the shape of those investigations at the outset. That means our class plans may change. Significant changes in class lessons, topics, or plans will be announced in class, posted in the `#general` Slack channel, and updated here at least a week ahed of time.

**Notes** for each lesson will be posted here before each class.

**Assignments** are due at 8 a.m. on the day of the next class (see details above).
