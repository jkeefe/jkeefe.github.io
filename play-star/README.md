[Deep Fun](./documents/deepfun.pdf) is a document outlining the descriptions of dozens of community- and group-building games used by some Unitarian Universalist youth groups.

[The Institute of Play Q Design Pack](./documents/IOP_Q_design_pack.pdf) was the basis I used for components of games and the modding of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

[Rock, Paper, Payoff: Child's Play Wins Auction House an Art Sale](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/29/arts/design/rock-paper-payoff-childs-play-wins-auction-house-an-art-sale.html) is the story about how the game was used to pick who would sell $20 million worth of art.

[Rock-Paper-Scissors: You vs. the Computer](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/science/rock-paper-scissors.html) is a link to the AI-driven game on the New York Times site.
